Computing energy levels
=======================

In the following we present all keywords and options relevant to the calculations of energy levels.

Calculation (input) setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Atoms:  defines the chemical symbols of the two atoms.

Example:
::

    atoms Na-23 H-2

specifies the 23NaD diatomic. Duo includes an extensive database of atomic properties (atomic masses,
nuclear spins, isotopic abundances and other quantities) and will use the appropriate values
when required. The database should cover all naturally-occurring nuclei as well as all radioactive ones
with a half-life greater than one day and is based on the AME2012 and
NUBASE2012 databases. Each atom should be specified by its chemical symbol,
a hyphen (minus sign) and the atomic mass number, like in the example above.
Atomic masses will be used, which is generally the most appropriate choice unless one is explicitely including
non-adiabatic corrections. The hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium can also
be optionally specified by the symbols ``D`` and ``T``.


The atomic mass number can be omitted, like in the following example:
::

     atoms Li F

In this case Duo will use the most-abundant isotopes (7Li and 19F in the example above) or, for
radioactive nuclei not naturally found, the longest lived one. For example 
::

     atoms Tc H

selects for technetium the isotope 97Tc, which is the longest-lived one. A few nuclides in the database are nuclear metastable isomers,
i.e. long-lived excited states of nuclei; these can be specified with a notation of the kind
::

     atoms Sb-120m H


In the example above the radioactive isotope of antimony 120mSb is specified (and hydrogen).
Another example
::

     atoms Sc-44m3 H

specifies the scandium radioactive isotope 44m3Sc (and hydrogen).



* masses:  

This is an optional keyword which specifies explicitely 
the masses of the two atoms (in Daltons, i.e. unified atomic mass units),
overriding the values from the internal database if the keyword \texttt{atoms} is also specified.

For example, the masses for the CaO molecule would be:
::

     masses 39.9625906 15.99491463
     
     
The masses may be atomic masses (the recommended choice if one does not include adiabatic or non-adiabatic corrections), nuclear masses.
An up-to-date reference of atomic masses is provided by the AME2012 catalogue (Chin. Phys. C, 36:1603â€“2014, 2012.)
Duo can also make use of position-dependent masses  (which is a practical way to account for non-adiabatic effects), see Bob-Rot.


* nstates:  is the number of potential energy curves (PECs) included in the calculation.
  
For example, if the ground state and four excited states of a molecule are to be included:
::

    nstates 5

Note that if ``nstates`` is set to a number different from the actual number of PECs  included in the 
input file no error message is issued; if more than nstates PECs are included in the input file then the PECs 
with ``state`` > ``nstates``  will be ignored.

Note also that, consistently with the way Duo works internally, ``nstates`` is the number of unique PECs in absence of spin-orbit couplings.


* jrot: specifies the set of total angular momentum quantum numbers to be computed.

These must be integers or half-integers, depending on whether there is an even or odd number of electrons.
One can directly specify the values (separated by spaces or commas), specify a range of values (a minimum
and a maximum values separated by a hyphen; note than the hyphen must be surrounded
by at least by one space on each side). The values do not have to appear in ascending order.
For example, the following line
:: 
      
      jrot 2.5, 0.5, 10.5 - 12.5,  20.5
     

specifies the set `J = 0.5, 2.5, 10.5, 11.5, 12.5, 20.5`.

The first ``J`` in the ``jrot`` list will be used to define the reference zero-point-energy (ZPE) value for the
run.

Note that in the optional sections specifying calculation of spectra (See Intensity) or
specifying fitting (section \ref{sec:fitting}) is necessary to specify again a list of
J values   by ``J`` and ``Jlist`` respectively, which are completely independent from the ``jrot`` value
specified for energy level calculation.


* symmetry:  (or ``Symgroup``) is an optional keywork specifying the molecular permutation-inversion symmetry group.

``Cs(M)`` is for heteronuclear diatomics and ``C2v(M)`` is for homonuclear diatomics. 

For example: 
::

    symmetry Cs(M)

Instead of ``C2v(M)`` one can write equivalently ``C2h(M)`` or ``G4(M)``, as these groups are isomorphic; 
the only difference will be in the labels used for the energy levels.
The short-hand notations ``Cs``, ``C2v``, ``C2h`` and ``G4`` can also be used and are equivalent to the ones with ``(M)``.
The energy calculations are done using ``Cs(M)``, which is also the default, while for the intensities the ``C2v(M)`` group can be also used.
Note that this keyword refers to the symmetry of the exact total (electronic, vibrational and rotational)
Hamiltonian and `not` to the :math:`C_{\infty v}` or the  :math:`D_{\infty h}` point groups, which are relative 
to the clamped-nuclei electronic Hamiltonian.

* DO_NOT_SHIFT_PECS: suppresses shifting the PEC to the minimum of potential 1 (assumed to the lowest). 

The default is to do the shift of the PECs to the minimum of  ``poten 1``. In order to suppress shifting  energies to ZPE, use
::

   ZPE 0.0

see also the description of the keyword ``ZPE``.



* SOLUTIONMETHOD * defines the DVR basis set and thus the DVR solution method for the vibrational problem. 

Possible methods include ``5POINTDIFFERENCES``.
:: 
     
     SOLUTIONMETHOD  5POINTDIFFERENCES
     

for the 5 points stencil finite differences to derive the kinetic energy operator. A more efficient method is Sinc DVR (default), which is switched on with
::

    SOLUTIONMETHOD  SINC

Since Sinc is also currently the default method, this does not have to be specified.



Defining the grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* grid: specifies an input section with the specifications of the grid of points.

It is used for the solution of the vibrational problem.

Example:
::

     grid
       npoints 501
       unit angstroms
       range 1.48 , 2.65
       type 0
     end


**Keywords**


* npoints: is the number of grid points Np. 
 
Typical runs use 100 to 500 points. 
::

   npoints 301

* units: is optional and specifies the unit of measure of the grid specifications; possible values are ``angstroms`` (default)
                    or ``bohrs``.

* range:   specifies the range of the grid in terms of rmin and rmax the lower and upper bond lengths. 

rmin should be strictly greater than zero and rmax strictly greater than rmin. As elsewhere in the program, the value
may be separated by a space or a comma. 


* type: Grid type

Is an integer number :math:`\ge 0` which specifies the type of grid.

Duo support not only uniformely spaced grids (default), which correspond to ``type 0``,
but also various kind on non-uniformely spaced ones, which are particularly useful for near-dissociation, 
very weakly bound states.
Example: 
::                   

     type 0

In the case of uniformely-spaced grids the mesh points `rj`, j=0, Np-1 are given by
:math:`r_j = r_\mathrm{min} + \Delta j \qquad \mbox{where} \qquad \Delta = \frac{ r_\mathrm{max}-r_\mathrm{min}} {N_p - 1}`


Non-uniformely spaced grids are based on a change of variables from `r` to `z=f(r)`; it is then
the transformed variable `z` that is uniformely sampled. The transformed variables `z` are 
parametrised by two parameters, :math:`r_e` and :math:`\alpha`, which have to be specified
for the grid types > 0 (see below).

Transformed variable currently implemented are (Phys. Rev. A, 78:052510, 2008):

:math:`\quad z=\exp( -e^{-\alpha (r-r_e)} )`

:math:`\quad z=1 - \left(1+ e^{\alpha (r-r_e)} \right)^{-1}`

:math:`\quad z= \arctan( \alpha (r-r_e) )`

:math:`\quad z= (y-1)/(y+1)` with :math:`y=(r/r_e)^\alpha`

All the transformed grids have the property of decreasing the density of points for large `r`, so that one does not `waste` too many points in
regions where the potential is almost constant and the corresponding vibrational wave function slowly varying.

* re:  (alias ``ref``)  Reference bond length used for ``type`` > 0 (see above). 

* alpha:  Parameter :math:`\alpha` for ``type >0`` (see above). 


Eigensolver
^^^^^^^^^^^

The input section ``EigenSolver`` (aliases: ``FinalStates``, ``diagonalizer``, ``FinalStates``) 
specifies 
various options relative to the `J>0` and/or the coupled problem; it also specifies
the LAPACK routine which should be used for matrix diagonalization (both for the solution of the
vibrational problem and for the solution of the coupled problem).
Example:
::

    Eigensolver
      enermax 25000.0
      nroots 500
      ZPE 1200.0
      SYEVR
    END


**Keywords**


* nroots  is the number of energy levels of the coupled problem to be computed (for any of the specified values of ``jrot``).

Example: 
::

    nroots 500

* enermax:  is an energy threshold  

``Enermax`` (aliases: ``uplimit``, ``enercut``) is to select the energy levels of the coupled problem to be computed (cm\ :math:`-1`). 

For example:
::

    enermax 15000.


If both ``nroots`` and ``enermax`` are  specified then only levels satisfying both criteria are selected.
Note that the present ``enermax`` threshold 
is distinct from the homonymous one in the ``vibrationalbasis`` input section, as the latter refers to the solution of the `J=0` 
uncoupled problem while the one being discussed
at present refers to the solution of the full (rotationally excited and/or coupled) problem.

* ZPE: Zero point energy 

``ZPE`` allows to explicitly input the zero-point energy (ZPE) of the molecule (in cm\ :math:`-1`). This affects the value printed, as
Duo always prints energy of rovibronic levels by subtracting the ZPE. Example:
::

     ZPE 931.418890
     
If ``ZPE`` is not included Duo will define the ZPE value as the lowest computed energy for the first value of `J` 
listed next to the ``jrot`` keyword (``jlist``), from the positive parity block. Currently it is not possible to 
take an automatic ZPE from the negative parity block (it is however possible in the intensity and fitting parts of the output).  
Thus ZPE does not necessarily have to be from the ground electronic state. 
This ZPE taken from the ``eigensolver``/``diagonalizer`` section changes the energies in the main, standard  Duo output.

The ZPE shift can be suppressed by setting the ZPE value to zero. This should be done either in the ``Diagonalizer``, ``Fitting`` or ``Intensity`` 
sections, depending on the current task:
::

    ZPE 0.0

* SYEVR or SYEV: LAPACK Eigesolvers 

This optional keywords permits to specify which routine from the LAPACK library should be used for
matrix diagonalization. At the moment only the two options quoted are implemented.
Example:
::

     SYEV

The SYEV routine (default) first reduces the matrix to diagonalize to tridiagonal form
using orthogonal similarity transformations, and then the QR algorithm is applied to the
tridiagonal matrix to compute the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors.
The SYEVR routine also reduces the matrix to diagonalize to tridiagonal form
using orthogonal similarity transformations but then, whenever possible,
computes the eigenspectrum using Multiple Relatively Robust Representations (MR).
SYEVR might give better performance, although exact timings are system- and case-dependent.

* ``ASSIGN_V_BY_COUNT`` 

The vibrational quantum number :math:`v` is assigned by counting the rovibronic states of the same ``State``, :math:`\Lambda`, 
:math:`\Sigma` arranged by increasing energy. The corresponding ``State``, :math:`\Lambda`, 
:math:`\Sigma` labels are defined using the largest-contribution approach 
(the quantum labels corresponding to the basis set contribution with the largest expansion coefficient).   
The keyword should appear anywhere in the body of the input file. The default is to use the largest-contribution  
approach also to assign the vibrational quantum number (no ``ASSIGN_V_BY_COUNT``).



Example: computing energy levels (one PEC)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here below there is a commented, minimalistic Duo input file for a single Morse potential; note that the input is case-insensitive.
In this particular example we compute the :math:`J=0` energy levels of a Morse oscillator :math:`V(r) = D_e (1-e^{-a(r-r_e)})^2` 
with :math:`D_e = 40000` cm\ :sup:`-1`,
:math:`r_e =1` Angstrom and :math:`a = 1` Angstrom\ :math:`^{-1}`; the masses of both atoms are both set to 1 Dalton, so that this example
is very approximately corresponds to the hydrogen molecule H:math:`_2`. The exact energy levels are given by 
:math:`E_n = \omega (n+1/2) \left[1 - x_e (n+1/2) \right]`, :math:`n=0, \ldots, 33`,
with :math:`\omega = a \sqrt{2 D_e/\mu} = 2322.593667` cm\ :sup:`-1` and :math:`x_e = \omega / (4 D_e) = 0.01451621`.

Duo will by default echo the whole of the input file in the output between the lines ``(Transcript of the input --->)`` and
(``<--- End of the input``). This is useful so that the ouput file will also contain the corresponding input.
To avoid echoing the input just add the keyword ``do_not_echo_input`` anywhere in the input file (but not within an input section).

*  Duo will then print its logo, the values of the physical constants (used by the program for such things as conversions between different units)
   and print some of the global input parameters such as the number of grid points, extent of the grid etc.

*  Duo will then print the values of all objects (PECs, dipole moment curves, couplings) on the internal grid. For PECs Duo will also
            compute and print quantities such as the value of the first few derivatives at the minimum, the corresponding equilibrium
            spectroscopic constants (harmonic frequency, rigid-rotor rotational constant etc.).

*  Duo will solve the :math:`J=0` one-dimensional Schroedinger equation for each of the PECs and print the corresponding 
   ``vibrational (contracted)`` energies.

*  Duo will then solve the full problem (with :math:`J >0` and/or all coupling terms activated). 
   In the example above we specified two values of :math:`J`, namely :math:`J=0` and :math:`J=10`. The :math:`J=0` 
   energies will be exactly the same as the ``vibrational (contracted)`` ones, as in our example there are no couplings at all.
