05.08.2014
The morphing part in grid is combined with the main after applying factor 

01.08.2014
Number of abinitio objects was incorrectly defined and was causing crashes for small Nstates

21.11.2014
Debye added; new checks for LX added 

23.11.2014
Bug with bobrot: should be a product of <v|brot|v'><v|bobrot|v'> v|brot x bobrot|v'>
New object lambdao is added to the input but not to the Hamiltonian matrix yet

23.11.2014
 - Changed to the 2-column input form for the parameters 
 - The fitting is now switched on by adding "f" after the parameter value nbut before "link"
 - omega is now a part of the fitting. It is used to "lock" the experimental assignemt
 - The new format for the energies/frequencies in the FITTING: omega collumn has to be present as the last before weights
 - In "lock" only absolute values are now used

24.11.2014
 - Three new duo objects added for Lambda-doubling: lambda-opq, lambda-o2q, lambda-q (still under construction)
 - One more checks for LX: cannot be diagonal 

26.11.2014
 - MOLPRO section, a number of changes and fixes

28.11.2014
 - SO MOLPRO: lambda+/- is selected based on the selection rules with sigma provided in input
 - MOLPRO: the first root is always positive unless the swap above 
 - dipole-x is introduced 

29.11.2014
 - INTENSITY NONE to skip intensity block
 - FIT or F to switch variation of parameter on
 - Lx is now working with MOLPRO as well
 - poten%jx_lz_y should not be used <- was replaced by ix_lz_y

12.12.2014
 - in intensity J accepts now " - " format
 - in freq-window and energy-low/upper 0 means 0-small_

25.12.2014
 - swap sigma and omega in output of frequencies
 - readl -> reada to allow for case-sensitive input

03.01.2015
 - lpambda-doubling implemented using Ref. JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY 74, 488-494 (1979)
   and tested for lambda-p2q for PS - seems to work
 - Bugs in the molpro convertion routine were found related to the non-diagonal SO-coupling 
 - Jmax =300 increased to Jmax=500

16.03.2015
 - C2v symmetry added for homonuclear molecules

11.04.2015
 - omp for intensities 

14.04.2015
 - make the intensities to be re-startable 

20.04.2015
 - changed in refinement.f90 nroots to nroots_max to prevent it to change later after duo_j0

05.06.2015
 - bug in molpro dipole for <Sigma||Pi> fixed

10.07.2015

- gns is now obtained from the nuclear spins, keyword nuclear-spin or nspin
- the selection rules are 1 1  for hetero- and 1 1 2 2 for homo-nuclear molecules. 
- Qstat is recomputed if Q=0 or not given
- ZPE=0 is default

12.08.2015
- poten_Hulbert_Hirschfelder added for SO

26.09.2015
- deviat -> wrms in fitting
- exomol format for integer J as integer i 
- fitting input can now contain integer J,Omega,sigma (hopefully)

09.10.2015
- bug with not defined  eigen(irot,irrep)%Ndimen= is fixed 
- input memory is implemented

10.10.2015
 - modified the function cosh-polynom

11.10.2015
 - iverbose is added to check_and_set_atomic_data 

18.10.2015
 - eigenfunc save and checkpointing are implemented; missing arraystop, deallocates are added to the fields in duo_j0
 - energy_filter removed

22.10.2015
 - improved header and format in the eigenfunc printouts 

26.10.2015
 - fixed bug in the eigen-save
 - added a new feature for the automatic weighting of ab initio field using PS1997 approach 
 - fixed a bug for molpro conversion of the ab initio fields. Potentially can affect the results of the the previous calculations. 

27.10.2015
 - poten_laura is implemented 

07.11.2015 
 - check of the allocated objects is introduced to prevent multiply allocation of fields during fitting

18.11.2015
 - a bug in the molpro-abinitio section is fixed

17.12.2015
 - the new feature with "atoms" did not work with "nspin" - which is now fixed.
 - two equivalent masses could be treated as C2V without having to introduce symgroup. 
   However something is not working in connection with atoms, so symgroup has to be specified for now. 

20.12.2015
 - If the symgroup is not defined before intensity, it is guessed based on atoms/masses
 - thresh_dipole is introduced to remove the transition dipoles generated from noise
 - In checkpoints, Nstates is the number of vibrational states, parity = 0,1 
24.01.2016
 - in fitting for energies/lock "state" added in the assignment section to the v,lambda,omega,sigma set 

09.02.2016
 - fix in the inout.f90
 - fix in diatom.f90 related to imulti being undefined
 - Lande factors (Mikhail Semenov)

13.11.2016
 - the e/f label was incorrect for closed-shell molecules in the linelist generation - corrected
 - Sigma and lambda are initialized to bad_values in order to trigger error-stop. For all fields
   but spin-orbits, sigma is set to spin.  
 - in the input/definition section, iref,jref are moved to set_field_refs
